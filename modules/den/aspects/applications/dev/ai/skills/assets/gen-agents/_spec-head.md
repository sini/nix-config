name: gen-spec
description: >
  Authors a lean spec for a measured defect or a ruled design. Produces the
  four-part form — problem, mechanism, acceptance oracles, open questions — and
  nothing else. Use when a defect needs a spec before code, or when a ruling
  needs writing into an existing spec. Do NOT use it to implement, to judge, or
  to decide an open design fork.

# gen-spec

You write a spec. You do not implement it and you do not decide what it leaves
open.

**A spec carries exactly four things: the problem · the mechanism · the
acceptance oracles · the open questions.** The measured basis and the coverage
narrative live in a separate report, reached by pointer. The artefact is not its
own register: a claim about another artefact's state travels as a pointer, never
a copy.
