# ccstatusline (github:sirmalloc/ccstatusline): the Claude Code status line, taken
# from the numtide collection we already ship as an input rather than from npx at
# runtime. Its own aspect in the beads.nix/rtk.nix mold — the binary, the config and
# the Claude Code wiring all live here.
#
# ★ THE CONFIG IS A READ-ONLY STORE SYMLINK, like ~/.claude/settings.json. Its own
# TUI (`ccstatusline` with no args) is still the right way to BROWSE widgets and
# preview colours, but its save will fail — change the layout HERE, not in the TUI.
# That is deliberate for a second reason: on save the TUI ALSO rewrites
# ~/.claude/settings.json to sync widget hooks, and that file is generated too.
